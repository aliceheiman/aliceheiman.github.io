Hey Friends!

I invite you on a journey to explore the exciting intersection of **coding for human and planetary health**.

On this site, you will find 

* **Technical deepdives**: Dive into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods applied to everything from forest health prediction to MRI analysis.

* **Book Notes**: Get notes and summaries of key books and papers in AI+Nature+Health.

* **Updates**: Stay up to date with exciting research, initiatives, and projects in AI for human and planetary health.

All of this is to explore the questions **how can we practically use coding for sustainable development, while minimizing the negative social and environmental impacts of AI?**

Excited to learn more?
