People often divide the predictions as follows:\n\nTrue Positive (TP): These are predicted positivies that are indeed actual positivies\nTrue Negative (TN): These are predicted negatives that are indeed actual negatives\nFalse Positive (FP): These are predicted positivies that are indeed actual negatives. They are not positives, although the model thought so!\nFalse Negative (FN): These are predicted negatives that are indeed actual positives.

Today, Landsat 7 and 8 collect 1,200 scenes, equivalent to 1 TB of data, every 24 hours1, adding 3 TB of landsat products2.\nAlphaEarth Foundations is Google DeepMind’s latest geospatial foundational AI model trained to assimilate thousands of image bands\nThe model is trained on 3 billion individual image frames sampled from over 5 million locations globally3. Some of the data bands include\n\nOptical and thermal imagery\nRadar data\n3D surface measurements\nClimate properties\nGravity fields\nGeo-located descriptive text\n…and more\n\nThrough training, the model can compress all of this data into 64 numbers for each 10mx10m location, ready for downstream analysis.\nThe Google DeepMind team open released the Satellite Embedding V1 Dataset, which contains annual 64-dimensional embeddings between 2017-2024 at a 10m resolution4."

These embeddings are constructed such that similar points (such as locations with solar panels) have embeddings pointing to locations close together on the sphere, while different points (such as solar panels vs. forest) have embeddings that point to different locations on the sphere.\n\n\nVideo\nSimilar locations have satellite embeddings close together, while different locations have embeddings that point in different directions.\n\n\nWhat’s special is that the embeddings capture similarities and difference both across space and time.\nThis means that it is possible to track changes in the same patch of land just by looking at the evolution of the embedding.\n\n\nVideo\nThe same geographical point can get different satellite embeddings over time, making it possible to track changes over time.\n\n\nThe indication of similarity between two spatio-temporal locations is then the angle between the satellite embedding coordinates.\nA popular similarity metric is the cosine similarity score, taking the cosine of the angle between the vectors.\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}}{|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|}\n\\]\nThe embedding coordinates in the AlphaEarth Foundation Satellite Embeddings dataset have already been normalized to have unit length (a length of one). Therefore, the cosine similarity simplifies to just the dot product between the embedding vectors. This is very efficient to compute.\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}\n\\]\nVisualizing the cosine similarity, it is possible to highlight areas that are either very similar or very different.\n\n\nVideo\nThe dot product between two satellite embedding vector coordinates measures the similarity between them."

But AlphaEarth is trained to interpolate between these.\nThese tasks can help with applications such as tracking deforestation and urban expansion, categorizing agricultural lands to aid in food security, and help model water resources."

But you still don’t get away from the complicated logistics of physical and interconnected systems.\nLet’s say you suddenly had the recipe for a hyper-efficient nuclear reactor. Even then, it would still take decades to develop the infrastructure and expertise to deploy, integrate, operate, and service the system. Unlike a vibe-coded website, transforming energy systems, rolling out universal vaccination programs, and ensuring equitable access to quality education cannot be done in hours, or even months. These challenges leave no room for waiting on perfect solutions. Action is already long overdue.\nThe best projects are often the ones that actually get done.
