We will have actual (real-world) and predicted (model-classified) classifications. People often divide the predictions as follows:\n\nTrue Positive (TP): These are predicted positivies that are indeed actual positivies\nTrue Negative (TN): These are predicted negatives that are indeed actual negatives\nFalse Positive (FP): These are predicted positivies that are indeed actual negatives. They are not positives, although the model thought so!\nFalse Negative (FN): These are predicted negatives that are indeed actual positives. They are not negatives, although the model thought so!\n\nWe can summarize these combinations in a confusion matrix, like so:\n\n\n\nA Confusion Matrix\n\n\nNow we can understand recall and precision."

The recall for the (P)lant class is how many plants you can produce. This is just the number of correct (P)lants divided by all (P)lants. The correct number of plants is simply our true positive (TP) count. The total number of plants is the sum of the ones we classified correctly (TP) and the plants we wrongly misclassified, i.e., the false negative (FN) count.\n\\[\\text{Recall (P)} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP + FN}}\\]\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\nThink of it this way: there is some pool of actual positive pixels out there.

Perfect recall implies that you, as a producer, can correctly label every single positive class pixel. However, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily make users happy if the model labels everything as the positive class.\nDifferent applications will require varying degrees of attentiveness to precision and recall. Applications where a misclassification could be lethal benefit from high precision standards. However, if it is costly to miss even a single instance, you might be more interested in recall.\nThank you for reading!"
