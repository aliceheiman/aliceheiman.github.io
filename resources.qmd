Here are some of my favorite resources for those interested in AI for human and planetary health.

## Organizations

* [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/): A non-profit and community committed to tackling climate change through machine learning. They host workshops, online happy hours, a community forum, and call for workshop papers at large AI conferences such as ICLR. 

## Podcasts

* [Outrage and Optimism](https://www.outrageandoptimism.org/): By Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac (oversaw the Paris Agreement), and Paul Dickinson (CDP founder) covering topics mainly in policy for a sustainable world.
